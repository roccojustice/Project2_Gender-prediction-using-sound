# My Portafolio

Hello and welcome to My Portfolio!

I'm Orlando Reyes and I'm an Industrial Engineer passionate about data. 

Through this series of projects I'm trying to portray my knowledge of Data Analysis with Python.

By clicking on the project you will see an abstract about it and the Python resources I used to solve each of the problems presented.

If you have any comments please feel free to reach me on any of [these platforms](https://linktr.ee/o.reyes) and I'll go back to you ASAP.

### Never stop learning!
