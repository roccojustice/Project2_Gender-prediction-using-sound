# [Project 5 - Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing]([https://github.com/roccojustice/Python-EDAs/tree/master/Project%205%20-%20Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Discovery%20of%20Handwashing#:~:text=Dr.%20Semmelweis%20and%20the%20Discovery%20of%20Handwashing.ipynb])
* Made some data cleaning over the dataset using pandas and numpy libraries.
* Compared data using measures of central tendency.
* Handled outliers to avoid problems in case of in deep statistical analysis.
* Performed data visualizations to oberve tendencies.
* Joined dataframes.

## Insights from the data
1. Speeding is the most common cause for stopping people.
2. Seems like women are more likely to get stopped by speeding than men.
3. However, both genders get almost the same proportion of tickets, warnings or arrests when stopped.
4. Male drivers are searched more than twice as often as female drivers no matter the reason for stop.
5. Officers made a search only 3.65% of the times whenever they stopped a vehicle/pedestrian.
6. Looks like officers stop more people during the night.
7. There has been a constant increase in drug contraband despite the fact that proportion of searches has been decreasing over the time.
8. Looks like weather doesn't cause more arrests made.

## Code and Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.8
* Packages: pandas, numpy, matplotlib
