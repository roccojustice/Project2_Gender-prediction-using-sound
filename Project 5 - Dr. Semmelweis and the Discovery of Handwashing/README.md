* Slicing
* Parsing dates
* Data visualization with matplotlib
* Use of central tendecy measures
* Bootstrapping
* Confidence intervals

## Insights from the data
1. An alarming number of women were dying as the result of childbirth befroe Dr. Semmelweis implement hygienic measures in hospitals
2. The proportion of women dying in Clinic1 was very high compared to Clinic2
3. Medicine students were tending women in Clinic1 but not in Clinic2
4. Starting from the summer of 1847 the proportion of deaths is drastically reduced, right after Dr. Semmelweis made handwashing obligatory
5. Handwashing reduced the proportion of deaths by between 6.7 and 10 percentage points, according to a 95% confidence interval

## Code and Resources Used
* Python Version: 3.8
* Packages: pandas, matplotlib
